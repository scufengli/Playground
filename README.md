Welcome to Game Ho'omana O Apalapala developed by Team 18 from TechWise Cohort II. In this readme file, we'll provide you with an overview of the game's key features, mechanics, and coding architecture.

**Game Overview:**

Our RPG game is composed of multiple levels, each comprising two parts. The first part is a Mario-styled game environment, while the second part features an underwater maze that connects the levels. Players are required to navigate this maze before their air supply runs out, adding an element of urgency to the gameplay.

**Game Mechanics:**

A central element of the maze gameplay is the integration of air bubbles. These bubbles serve as a lifeline, granting players extra time to explore the maze. However, beware of the Piranhas, which reduce the player's air supply upon contact, adding an element of challenge and risk.

Moreover, the game presents an ultimate challenge in the form of a Naga that guards the escape point. To confront this formidable opponent, players must first locate a spear, which acts as their primary means of defense.

**Coding Architecture:**

Maze game's code is structured using an entity class as the foundation. This class serves as a blueprint for various other classes in the game. Particularly significant is the character class, which inherits properties from the entity class. This design approach provides a systematic method for managing moving objects within the game.

The flexibility of this architecture also enables the creation of distinct child classes for different moving elements, facilitating efficient development and maintaining a well-organized codebase.
